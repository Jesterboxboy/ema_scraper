This tournament claims 85 players, but lists 84. This upsets the ranking calculation.
I've put a manual kludge in the code to deal with this.

UK OPEN RIICHI 2017

Ian Fraser got 333 ranking points, pretty sure that should be 359 (came =26th out of 40)

3RD OPEN ITALIAN CHAMPIONSHIP

Foschi Elisa got 113 ranking points, but should be 127 (came =63rd out of 72)
Actually, check whether this is the right way to deal with ties, and all the others are wrong!!!
